            <p>

            </p>
            <ul class="tw-mb-4 tw-ps-4">

You retain responsibility for third-party copyright and trademark claims.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">5. No Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) or Profit Guarantees</h3>
            <p>
                Digital advertising performance depends on market demand, competitive bids, audience behavior, creative relevance, product pricing, and algorithmic delivery on third-party networks. <strong>Adsbooster makes no guarantees, representations, or warranties, express or implied, regarding Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), conversion rates, traffic volume, or business profitability.</strong> Any ad spend paid to ad networks (Meta, Google, TikTok) is at your sole risk and is non-refundable by Adsbooster.

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">6. User Accounts, Credentials &amp; Security</h3>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and API keys. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or breach of security. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is strongly recommended for all accounts and is mandatory for administrative privileges.

            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">8. Marketplace, Escrow &amp; P2P Contracts</h3>
            <p>
                Users participating in the Adsbooster Marketplace, creator bounties, or peer-to-peer contract agreements do so under our escrow protection rules. Work deliverables must meet the agreed contract terms before escrow funds are released. Disputes are arbitrated by the Adsbooster Trust &amp; Safety board whose decisions are final.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>

            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">10. Indemnification &amp; Hold Harmless</h3>
            <p>
                You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Adsbooster and its licensees and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of: (a) your use and access of the Service; (b) your violation of any term of these Terms; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (d) any claim that your creatives or ad campaigns caused damage to a third party or violated ad network policies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">11. Binding Arbitration &amp; Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>
                Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof shall be settled by binding individual arbitration rather than in court. <strong>You and Adsbooster agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 text-white fw-bold tw-mt-6 tw-mb-3">12. Changes to Terms</h3>
